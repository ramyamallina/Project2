Overview: This project aims to predict the survival outcomes of COVID-19 patients using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from the Mexican government, which includes information on over 1 million COVID-19 patients, we classify patients into two categories: those likely to survive and those at greater risk

Data: "COVID-19 Dataset" from Kaggle, courtesy of the Mexican government.

Tools: Pandas and NumPy for cleaning and sampling the dataset.Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore distributions and correlations among variables.

Highlights: Utilized logistic regression to predict patient outcomes based on variables like age, gender, comorbidities, and ICU admission status.
